    <p style="text-align: center;margin-top: 2rem;">This is a comparision between my home page and the page from where I took refereance to make my home page. The image on the left is the reference picture and the image on the right is the home page I made. I tried to make the same navigation bar with few changes like hover effect and postion of the navigation bar. The login form and social media icon on left side my home was a idea I randomly got while brainstroming.</p>

</div>
<p style="text-align: center;margin-top: 2rem;">This is a comparision between my home page and the page from where I took refereance to make my home page. The image on the left is the reference picture and the image on the right is the home page I made. I added and changed few things from the refereance page. I added a hover effect on the picture of the product which gives the customer to choose 3 new options i.e. quick shop, wishlist and add to cart. I also made the container of the product to transparent and added stars rating of each product. Rest, I tried to make same as the reference page as much as possible, excluding the background image.</p>

    <h2 class=researchh2>Research on Blog</h2>
<div class="imagesz">
<img style="width:50%"src="./research/blog.jpg" alt="">
<img style="width:50%"src="./research/blog2.png" alt="">
</div>
<p style="text-align: center;margin-top: 2rem;"> This is a comparision between my home page and the page from where I took refereance to make my home page. The image on the left is the reference picture and the image on the right is the home page I made. I changed the background by covering the whole background by the image and covered the whole page within the border unlike the reference page. I tried to to make text formatting style same as shown on the reference image. I also placed the navigation bar on center-top of the page unlike the reference page .</p>

    <h2 class=researchh2>Research on Research page</h2>
<div class="imagesz">
<img style="width:50%"src="./research/research.jpg" alt="">
<img style="width:50%"src="./research/research1.png" alt="">
</div>
<p style="text-align: center;margin-top: 2rem;"> This is a comparision between my home page and the page from where I took refereance to make my home page. The image on the left is the reference picture and the image on the right is the home page I made. Both page are very similar to each other. Both pages has 2 pictures in a single row, the only change is that I have added text to explain the research done for each page and I have also added a navigation bar on the cnter-top of my research page.</p>
<div class=hHead>
    <h2 class=researchh2>Research on contact us</h2>

<img style="width:50%"src="./research/contact us2.png" alt="">
</div>
<p style="text-align: center;margin-top: 2rem;">This is a comparision between my home page and the page from where I took refereance to make my home page. The image on the left is the reference picture and the image on the right is the home page I made. This page is rather similar if we only talk about the form part. Same as the rest of the pages I made, I added background image, navigation bar, socail media icon, but the form are almost similar. I changed the buttom color to yellow and added a box-shadow also in yellow color and changed the text border into a single underline.</p>
